<p>Supervising the quality of data collection is not straightforward. Survey questionnaires are often quite long and have systematic control is worth automatizing.</p>
<p><code>HighFrequencyCheck</code> can be used to detect programming errors, surveyor errors, data fabrication, poorly understood questions, and other issues. The results of these checks can also be useful in improving your survey, identifying enumerator effects, and assessing the reliability of your outcome measures. It allows teams to catch survey issues and collection mistakes in time to correct them and ensure high-quality data</p>
<p>The <code>HighFrequencyCheck</code> package is a translation in in R of the <a href="https://github.com/PovertyAction/high-frequency-checks">Stata package</a> based on <a href="https://www.povertyactionlab.org/resource/data-quality-checks">best practices from Innovations for Poverty Action</a>. High Frequency Checks are also recommend by the <a href="https://dimewiki.worldbank.org/wiki/High_Frequency_Checks">World Bank</a>. It can be installed from github with <code><a href="https://devtools.r-lib.org//reference/remote-reexports.html">devtools::install_github("unhcr/HighFrequencyChecks")</a></code>.</p>
<p>The package brings a series of convenience functions to monitor data quality during the data collection when running a survey with <a href="http://kobo.unhcr.org">KoboToolbox</a> (or any <code>xlsform</code> compatible platform).</p>
<p>Those are the basis of a feedback mechanism with enumerators and can be performed periodically during the data collection process to check for possible errors and provide meaningful inputs to the enumerators. All these functions do not have to be ran at the same period of time. They are provided there to help data supervisor to build reports:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>A <code>wrapper</code> function is included to generate directly an final data quality assessment Rmd Report</p></li>
<li><p>A <code>ShinyApp</code> Interface is also included to provide a live monitoring dashboard to be run locally.</p></li>
</ul>
<div id="introduction-measuring-data-collection-quality" class="section level2">
<h2 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#introduction-measuring-data-collection-quality" class="anchor"></a>Introduction: Measuring data collection quality</h2>
<p>Data collection quality monitoring includes 4 different dimensions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Correct set-up of data collection devices</li>
<li>Data collected according the sampling plan</li>
<li>Enumerator rigorous work standards</li>
<li>Enumerator productivity</li>
</ol>
<p>Ideally the data collection monitoring dashboard should be known to all enumerators so that they are aware of the data quality metrics that will be used to assess the quality of their work and potentially some incentive can be offered for the enumerators performing on the quality metrics (<em>It is good to recall that each records in household survey cost between 15 to 50 USD</em>). Some of those indicators can support some remedial supervision interventions, such as calling individually the enumerator and point some specific issues that were detected.</p>
<p>It is important to prepare high frequency checks (code and instructions), as part of the data quality assurance plan, before before starting with field data collection.</p>
<p>Below are the required configuration and an illustration of those indicators based on a demo dataset included in the package.</p>

<p>When it comes to back checks, variables can be divided into the following different categories:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type 1 variables are based on straightforward questions where there is <strong>very little possibility of error</strong>. For example, age and education. If there is an error in these variables, it means there is a serious problem with enumerator, or with the questions.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 2 variables are based on questions where a <strong>risk of error is possible</strong>. For example, questions based on sensitive topics, or questions that involve calculations or classification with possibility of ‘or other’. If there is an error in these variables, there might be a need to provide further training for enumerators.</p></li>
<li><p>Type 3 variables are based on questions about the survey instrument, and errors in this case provide feedback which can help improve the survey instrument itself. This is often the case for questions including <strong>or other, please specify</strong> question type.</p></li>

<p>These checks are designed to ensure that responses are consistent for a particular survey instrument, and that the responses fall within a particular range. For example, checks to ensure that all variables are standardized, and there are no outliers in the data. Share a daily log of such errors, and check if it is an issue with enumerators, in which case there might be a need to re-train enumerators.</p>
<p>Missing data: Are some questions skipped more than others? Are there questions that no respondents answered? This may indicate a programming error.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Categorical variables: Are respondents selecting the given categories or are many respondents selecting “None of the above”, or “other”? If conducting a survey, you may want to add categories or modify your existing ones.</p></li>

<p>These are designed to check if data shared by any particular enumerator is significantly different from the data shared by other enumerators. Some parameters to check enumerator performance include percentage of “Don’t know” responses, or average interview duration. In the first case, there might be a need to re-draft the questions, while in the second case, there might be a need to re-train enumerators.</p>
<div id="responses-with-outliers" class="section level4">
<h4 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#responses-with-outliers" class="anchor"></a>Responses with outliers</h4>
<p>Outliers: Are some respondents reporting values drastically higher or lower than the average response? Do these variables need to be top or bottom coded? Many outlier checks can be directly programmed into the survey, either to flag responses or bar responses that are outside the acceptable range.</p>
