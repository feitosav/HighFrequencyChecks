\item{HHSize}{name as a string of the field in the dataset where the household size is stored}

\item{reportingcol}{columns as a list of string name from the dataset you want in the result (c('col1','col2',...))}

\item{minduration}{minimum acceptable survey duration as integer in minutes}

\item{delete}{delete action to be done as a boolean (TRUE/FALSE)}

ds same dataset as the inputed one but with survey marked for deletion if errors are found and delete=TRUE

errors  list of the errors found

\description{
This function check that the duration relative to the household size of each interview is more than a specified threshold.
There is an option to automatically mark for deletion the surveys which are under the threshold.
Warning: If there are uncorrected mistakes in the survey dates, it can lead to have the length of the survey in seconds and this check will not performed well
